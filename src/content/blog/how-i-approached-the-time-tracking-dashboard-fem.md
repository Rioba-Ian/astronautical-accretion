My experience in using Typescript for the dashboard time tracker frontend mentor challenge.

## Motivation

I have been learning typescript for a while and I considered a project which would get my hands on the keyboard trying out stuff in a new way. I wanted a project which required a lot of dom manipulation as I would now use typescript. The [live application](https://rioba-ian.github.io/time-tracking-dashboard-main/).
